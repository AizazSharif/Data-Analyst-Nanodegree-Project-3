# Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data Using Python and MongoDB

You will choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about (using python). Finally, you will use MongoDB as the data schema to complete your project.
